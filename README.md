# Lottery Dapp

🐧 🐧 Lottery 🐧🐧

🗳️ Introducing my Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) powered by OpenZeppelin Governance and ERC20 Tokens! 🌐

I've used techs like The Graph, Hardhat, Solidity, ReactJS, Ethers.js , thirdweb development

Propose game-changing ideas and watch them transform into reality. Prepare for voting as proposals gain momentum, and then cast your vote with just a few clicks. Vote for, against, or abstain—your decision counts! 💪

🌟 How It Works:
Propose: Share your game-changing ideas for the DAO.
Prepare: Voters get time to research and get ready for voting.
Vote: Cast your choice for, against, or abstain.
Incentives: Get rewarded with free tokens for voting!
Execute: Winning proposals become reality.
Transparency: Witness the results unfold!
